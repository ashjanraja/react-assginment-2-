1) Using useState, render a text "Hello World", on clicking it, 
it should toggle to "Hello Palestine",and vice versa!
2) Create Input tag, and get email, and username from user, AddEvent onChange
 and save the email and username to the state and show these values in the p or
h1 tage above the form, So when page load user only see 2 inputs but when user
add some characters in the input, the heading should show, if user input email 
the value Email: <email> show above if user input username the value in the h or p
tag should be Username: <username>, if user input both username and email then both
values should show above the input
3) Using useState, initiate a array with random sentences with the length of 10 (minimum),
and add the button with this button name="Change Sentence" When user click on button the sentence 
should change, use Math.random() function to select random index from array and show that
index sentence to the user.
